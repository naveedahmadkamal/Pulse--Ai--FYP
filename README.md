Pulse AI
 
Pulse AI is a full-stack, production-oriented healthcare AI platform designed to provide disease-wise medical prediction and classification using Machine Learning models. Each disease is handled by a dedicated ML model, deployed through Flask APIs and consumed by a modern web interface.



🚀 Project Vision

The goal of Pulse AI is to build a scalable, modular, and real-world healthcare AI system — not just a typical academic FYP. The project focuses on:


Clean ML pipelines

API-based model deployment

Modern frontend integration

Production-ready architecture


🧠 Supported Diseases (Planned)

Hypertension / Blood Pressure

Heart Disease

Stroke Prediction

Diabetes Prediction

Breast Cancer

Liver Disease

Chronic Kidney Disease

Brain Tumor (MRI Images)

Pneumonia (Chest X-ray)


🏗️ Tech Stack


Machine Learning

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

TensorFlow / PyTorch (for image-based models)

Backend

Flask

REST APIs

Model Serialization (Pickle / Joblib)

Frontend

Next.js

React.js

Tailwind CSS

Others

Git & GitHub

REST API Architecture

Modular Project Structure


⚙️ System Architecture (High Level)

Disease-specific datasets are preprocessed and used to train ML models
Each trained model is exposed via a Flask REST API
Frontend (Next.js + React) consumes APIs for prediction
Results are displayed in a clean, user-friendly web interface
